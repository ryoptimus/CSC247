Overview: Utilize the bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) model and apply it to the part-of-speech (PoS) tagging task.

Tasks:
1 Data Preparation
Utilize Pytorch, TorchText, and spaCy. Use the UDPOS dataset.

2 BiLSTM Implementation

3 Model Training and Evaluation
Write the function used to compute the accuracy for model evaluation.
Additionally, record the training dynamics, including the error, loss function values, etc., in the project report. You may use the maplotlib library to plot the training dynamics.
